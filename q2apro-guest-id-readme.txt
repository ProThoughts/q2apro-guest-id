# Premium Plugin: Guest-ID

    "Nobody in our forum knew which post belonged to 'anonymous'. Now with this plugin, everything got so transparent. Thanks a lot!" 

	
# Description

	Gives all anonymous users that are posting in your forum a unique ID and makes it easier to identify them in a thread.


# Features

    - gives each anonymous user in your forum a unique id
    - choose from three id options: 5 digits, 2 letters + 2 digits, 2 letters + 3 digits
    - the id gets calculated from the IP address
    - the default display name for "anonymous" can be changed
    - if you have q2a v1.6 or higher: if anonymous visitor posts specifying a name, the ID gets attached after the name
    - available languages: en, fr, de


# How the algorithm works:

    - at first we convert the IP "123.45.78.22" to integer. In PHP via ip2long() from "123.45.78.22" we get "2066566678"
    - from this integer we take the first and the second digit (2 und 0)
    - both numbers are mapped to an array: array('a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i','j','k') - "2" becomes "c" and "0" becomes "a"
    - additionally we take the 3rd and 4th digit from the integer. From 2066566678 we get "66"
    - finally we combine all elements and get "guest ca66"
	- As you can see, it is impossible to conclude the IP from the generated ID "ca66"!
